I joined the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) in Fall 2018. I was an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/) at the [Portland State University](http://www.pdx.edu/) since Fall 2016. During 2013 to 2016, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](http://iqc.uwaterloo.ca) and the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization](http://math.uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/) at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca). I completed my PhD in 2013 in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.psu.edu/) at the [Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu), under the supervision of Prof. [Sean Hallgren](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~hallgren). Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from [University of Science & Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2008.

My research interests lie in cryptography, especially in the presence of quantum attacks (a.k.a. post-quantum crypto), quantum algorithms, computational complexity and theoretical computer science broadly.

## News

<!--*  I will be offering an introductory course on **Quantum computing** in Spring 2017. Check out the course information [here]({{base}}/teaching/s17_4510_qc/). -->
* **September 2018**: I have a **post-doctorate** fellow openning at TAMU to work on quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography. The focus will be either on quantum provable security or quantum algorithms for post-quantum candidate problems. Starting date is flexible, and an official ad will be out soon. Shoot me an email if you (or know someone who) are interested and have related research experience. 
*   **I AM HIRING!** I am looking for self-motivated students who are
    interested in pursuing a PhD degree with me. Please feel free
    to reach me! <!-- Find more [here]({{base}}/recruit/).-->
<!--*  I will serve on the program committee of [PQCrypto 2018](http://www.math.fau.edu/pqcrypto2018/){:target="_blank"}. It will be co-located with the 1st [NIST PQC Standardization Conference](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/workshops-and-timeline){:target="_blank"} at **Fort Lauderdale, Florida** Please submit your nice research results and hope to meet you there! -->
*  With an undergraduate and a Master's student, we prove optimimal
   quantum query lower bounds and give quantum algorithms for finding
   collisions in a family of non-uniform random functions. Read
   more [here](http://ia.cr/2017/688){:target="_blank"}. 
*  CBC-MAC and a few others
   were [broken](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05973){:target="_blank"}
   by quantum attacks, But **NMAC** and **HMAC** remain
   quantum-secure, as we prove in our Crypto'17 paper. Check it
   out [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/509){:target="_blank"}.
<!-- *  My talk on **ZK for QMA** at QIP'17 is now avaible on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fXLJBN-KfI&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}.-->	
<!--*  Our department has a tenure-track faculty position available. Read
       more

       will like it here!-->
*  [Asiacrypt 2017](http://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2017/){:target="_blank"} will be held in **Hong Kong**, and I am happy to serve on the program committee. Please submit your excellent papers!
<!--*  I will serve on the program committee of [PQCrypto 2017](https://2017.pqcrypto.org/conference/){:target="_blank"}.  **Utrecht, the Netherlands** is awaiting your nice research results!-->
<!--*  I organized a one-day event on quantum computing and
   cryptography at Portland, OR. Find the details [here]({{base}}/activity/w17qpdx/) or a poster [PDF]({{base}}/activity/w17qpdx/qpdxposter.pdf){:target="_blank"}.-->

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/) at the [Portland State University](http://www.pdx.edu/). I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](http://iqc.uwaterloo.ca) and the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization](http://math.uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/) at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca) during 2013 to 2016. I completed my PhD in 2013 in [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.psu.edu/) at the [Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu), under the supervision of Prof. [Sean Hallgren](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~hallgren). Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from [University of Science & Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2008.

My research interests lie in cryptography, especially in the presence of quantum attacks (a.k.a. post-quantum crypto), quantum algorithms, computational complexity and theoretical computer science broadly.

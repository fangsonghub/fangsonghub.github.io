I am an Associate Professor in the [Computer Science
Department](http://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/) at the [Portland
State University](http://www.pdx.edu/). During 2013 to 2016, I was a
postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute for Quantum
Computing](http://iqc.uwaterloo.ca) and the [Department of
Combinatorics and
Optimization](http://math.uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/)
at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca). I completed my
PhD in 2013 in [Computer Science and
Engineering](http://www.cse.psu.edu/) at the [Pennsylvania State
University](http://www.psu.edu), under the supervision of [Sean
Hallgren](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~hallgren). Prior to that, I received
my bachelor's degree from [University of Science & Technology of
China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2008.

My research interests lie in cryptography, especially
provable-security in the presence of quantum attacks, quantum
algorithms, computational complexity and theoretical computer science
broadly. I'm grateful to the [National Science
Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/){:target="_blank"} (including a
Career Award) and the [SONY
Group](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/research-award-program/) for
funding my research.

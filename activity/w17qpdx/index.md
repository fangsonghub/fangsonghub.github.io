## About

*   **When**: Friday January 13, 2017
*   **Where**: Willamette Falls, [University Place Hotel and Conference
    Center](http://www.uplacehotel.com/contact-us/) at downtown Portland, OR. Directions [below](#direction).
*   **What**: Curious about what the new paradigm of **quantum computing** has to offer? How will it change the way computers work and how it will affect **cryptography** that we rely on for providing cybersecurity? This one-day public lectures will be your treat. World-leading experts will share their views and insights with you. This event is open to the general audience. You do not need to register, and just come by and enjoy!

## Talk information

1. <a name="ga"></a>**Quantum algorithms and cryptography**
by [Gorjan Alagic](http://www.alagic.org/).  <br>**Abstract**: In the 1980s, physicists speculated that it might be possible to engineer computational devices whose inner workings are based on the laws of quantum mechanics. In the early 90s, scientists realized that such “quantum computers” would perform a fundamentally new and different kind of computation. For instance, quantum computers could quickly solve some algorithmic problems which are effectively impossible for current “classical” computers (e.g., phones, laptops, supercomputers.) These problems are not purely of academic interest: they include factoring, which forms the basis of most public-key cryptography in use today. In this talk, I will discuss the fundamental concepts behind quantum computation, and sketch some of the basics of the underlying theory. I will then discuss some quantum algorithms and their applications, with a particular focus on consequences for cryptography. 

2. <a name="cs"></a>**Quantum cryptography** by [Christian Schaffner](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~schaffne/). <br> **Abstract**: 

3. <a name="zj"></a>**Non-local games** by [Zhengfeng Ji](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=2uXdu7AAAAAJ). <br> **Abstract**:

4. <a name="kc"></a> **General Randomness Amplification with Non-signaling Security** by [Kai-Min Chung](http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~kmchung/). <br>**Abstract**: Highly unpredictable events appear to be abundant in life. However, when modeled rigorously, their existence in nature is far from evident. In fact, the world can be deterministic yet at the same time the predictions of quantum mechanics are consistent with observations. Assuming that randomness does exist but only in a weak form, could highly random events be certifiably demonstrated? 
<br>  In this talk, we resolve this question positively by constructing the first no-signaling secure device-independent randomness amplification protocol that works for arbitrary weak sources with sufficient entorpy. Our result implies that the laws of physics either do not allow randomness or allow it in an almost perfect quality. The assumptions under which we derive our conclusion are minimal and in particular do not rely on any structural or independence conditions assumed in previous works. If in addition quantum mechanics is assumed to be complete, our result implies that an unbounded amount of almost perfect randomness can be experimentally produced from a single source of weak randomness. <br>Joint work with Yaoyun Shi and Xiaodi Wu.

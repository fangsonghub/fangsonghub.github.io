## Summer 2023 (Tentative Projects)

### 1. Quantum computing

The first phase is to learn the basics of quantum computing (QC),
including the formalism and basic quantum algorithms.

In the second phase, there are two options to consider.

*  (Preferred) Status of research funding or job market of QC. The
   study of the research funding aims to reveal the funding resources,
   especially at the federal and state levels, and to make suggestions
   for improvement (e.g., regarding equity and diversity). The study of
   the job market aims to identify the trend and prospect of the QC
   industry.

*  For the tech-savy ones, you can survey a cutting-edge research
   topic or explore applications of QC in areas of your interest.

### 2. New Directions of Blockchain

The first phase is to learn the basics of blockchain technology,
expecially in the context of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

In the second phase, one can diverge into two possible routes. 
*  Quantum-proof Bitcoin with post-quantum hash-based signatures. The
   digital signature (ECDSA) in current Bitcoin can be broken by
   quantum computers. The goal here is to replace it with a
   post-quantum signature scheme.
*  Explore new possiblities that combine blockchain technology and
   Large Generative models (e.g., GPT-4).

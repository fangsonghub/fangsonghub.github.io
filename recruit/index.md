I am inviting Ph.D. applications in _cryptography, quantum computing,
and general areas of theoretical computer science_ (TCS) starting
**Fall 2018**, in the [Computer Science Department](computer-science/)
at [Portland State University](http://www.pdx.edu/). Competitive
financial supports (TAship and RAship) are available with
comprehensive benefits.

Portland State U is located in the heart
of [Portland, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon),
one of America's most dynamic cities. It gives unmatched access to
career connections
(e.g., [Intel](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html))
and an internationally acclaimed
natural [recreational destination](https://traveloregon.com/)
and
[culture scene](https://www.travelportland.com/things-to-do/culture/). Recently,
it's becoming an emerging hub for IT industry (Portland gets its
nickname
[silicon forrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Forest)) and
quantum computing
([Intel lab](https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/10/intel-superconducting-test-chip-quantum-computing/),
[QuArC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/microsoft-quantum-redmond-quarc/) of
Microsoft Research at Redmond, WA).  

A solid math background and strong interest in TCS are
crucial. Suitable students from majors other than computer science
(Math, Physics, Electrical Engineering etc.) are also encouraged to
apply. It is advised that you contact with me to discuss your
individual case. Please see below for more information about the
application process, my research and the requirements. Please do not
hesitate to reach me for any questions.

*  **Contact**: [Fang Song](http://fangsong.info) [http://fangsong.info](http://fangsong.info)
*  **Email**: [fsong at pdx.edu](mailto:fsong@pdx.edu)
*  **Starting Date**: Fall 2018
*  **Application Deadline**: March 1, 2018 (official date). However,
   review starts immediately upon receiving your complete application,
   so please start early. 

## How to apply?
Please refer to the application guideline
here
[https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/graduate-admission][gradapplink]. Check
out more about the [**Master's Program**][mslink]{:target="_blank"}
(a [poster]({{base}}/files/docs/mscs.pdf){:target="_blank"}), and
the
[**PhD program**](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/doctor-of-philosophy-in-computer-science){:target="_blank"}.

*  Master's degree is **NOT** required for the PhD application. A
   Bachelor's degree suffices.

*  Please **mention my name** in your application, or preferably get
   in touch with me before/during the application process.

## What do I do?

Quantum computing provides a new paradigm for computation, and it
brings in fatal threats to existing cryptography (e.g. public-key
crypto will be largely broken). The central question driving my
research is: how does quantum computing change the landscape of
cryptography? This leads to three broad directions. The first two are
concerned with the security of classical cryptosystems in the presence
of quantum adversaries, and the third explores constructing quantum
schemes to protect classical as well as quantum information.

*  Designing quantum algorithms and understanding the computaiontal
   hardness especially for problems that are critical for
   cryptography.

*  Developing formal models and techniques for reasoning about quantum
   adversaries and analyzing security in the presence of quantum attacks. 

*  Exploring the power of quantum information processing, including
   quantum cryptography (honest users use quantum technology for both
   classical and quantum cryptographic tasks), quantum computational
   complexity.

Feel free to scan through my [papers]({{base}}/research/) to get some idea. 

## What am I expecting?

Other than reasonable maturity in math (in particular _Probability_,
_Linear Algebra_) and core CS knowledge, what TCS requires the most is
your self-motivation and perseverance (true for PhD in general but
more so in TCS). You have to enjoy what you do and lead your way by
your curiosity and determination. Read the many web discussions on why
go to TCS
(e.g. [http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1562/why-go-to-theoretical-computer-science-research][TCS]),
and if you find NO resonance with those comments, you may want to
think again before you apply.

## More opportunities & info 

* Master's students are typically admitted without fininal
  aid. However, there are abundent TA positions available for
  application every term, which comes with tuition waiver and
  stipend. Depending on my grant status, I may support you with RAship
  as well.

* CS @ Portland State University is young and active. It is already
  strong in Programming Language, machine learning, systems, computer
  vision etc. Check the other faculty members and their exciting
  research

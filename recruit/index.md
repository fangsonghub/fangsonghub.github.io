I am inviting PhD applications in _cryptography, quantum computing,
and general areas of theoretical computer science_ (TCS) starting
**Fall 2017**, in the [Computer Science Department](computer-science/)
at [Portland State University](http://www.pdx.edu/). Portland State U
is located in the heart
of [Portland, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon),
one of America's most dynamic cities. It gives unmatched access to
career connections
(e.g., [Intel](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html))
and an internationally acclaimed culture scene. Competitive financial
support (TAship and RAship) are available with comprehensive benefits.

A solid math background and strong interest in TCS are
crucial. Suitable students from majors other than computer science
(Math, Physics, Electrical Engineering etc.) are also encouraged to
apply. It is advised that you contact with me to discuss your
individual case. Please see below for more information about the
application process, my research and the requirements. Please do not
hesitate to reach me for any questions.

*  **Contact**: [Fang Song](http://fangsong.info) [http://fangsong.info](http://fangsong.info)
*  **Email**: [fsong at pdx.edu](mailto:fsong@pdx.edu)
*  **Starting Date**: Fall 2017
*  **Application Deadline**: March 1, 2017 (official date). However,
   review starts immediately upon receiving your complete application,
   so please start early.

## How to apply?
Please refer to the application guideline
here
[https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/graduate-admission][gradapplink]. Master's
degree is **NOT** required for the PhD application. A Bachelor's
degree suffices. Please **mention my name** in your application, or
preferably get in touch with me during the application process. 

## What do I do?

Quantum computing provides a new paradigm for computation, and it
brings in fatal threats to existing cryptography (e.g. public-key
crypto will be largely broken). The central question driving my
research is: how does quantum computing change the landscape of
cryptography? This leads to three broad directions. The first two are
concerned with the security of classical cryptosystems in the presence
of quantum adversaries, and the third explores constructing quantum
schemes to protect classical as well as quantum information.


*  Designing quantum algorithms and understanding the computaiontal
   hardness especially for problems that are critical for
   cryptography.

*  Developing formal models and techniques for reasoning about quantum
   adversaries and analyzing security in the presence of quantum attacks. 

*  Exploring the power of quantum information processing, including
   quantum cryptography (honest users use quantum technology for both
   classical and quantum cryptographic tasks), quantum computational
   complexity.

Feel free to scan through my [papers]({{base}}/research/) to get some idea. 

## What am I expecting?

Other than reasonable maturity in math (in particular _Probability_,
_Linear Algebra_) and core CS knowledge, what TCS requires the most is your self-motivation and perseverance (true for PhD in general but more so in TCS). You have to enjoy what you do and lead your way by your curiosity and determination. Read the many web discussions on why go to TCS
(e.g. [http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1562/why-go-to-theoretical-computer-science-research][TCS]),
and if you find NO resonance with those comments, you may think again
before you apply.

## More opportunities & info 

* CS @ Portland State University is young and active. It is already
  strong in Programming Language, machine learning, systems, computer
  vision etc. Check the other faculty members and their exciting
  research

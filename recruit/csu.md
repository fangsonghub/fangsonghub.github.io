宋方教授将介绍他在**密码学**及**量子计算**等方向的研究。同时他会介绍关于申请攻读他的博士学位的相关信息。欢迎各位前来交流，尤其是有意出国留学的同学！

Dr. Fang Song will give a tour about his research on the challenges
and opportunites that modern cryptography encounters due to the new
computation paradigm of quantum computing. He will also take the
opportunity to introduce the MS/PhD positions he has available to work in
cryptography, quantum computing and theoretical computer science in
general. All are welcome, especially students who are interested in studying abroad!  More info. about the MS/PhD applications can be found [here](http://www.fangsong.info/recruit/){:target="_blank"}.

*  **题目 (Title)**: 量子时代的密码学 (Cryptography in a quantum world)
*  **摘要 (Abstract)**: 量子计算的发展将带来密码学的一场革命。许多现在广泛使用的公钥密码学（例如RSA加密）将会被量子计算机破解。我将介绍密码学遇到的挑战与机遇，并重点分享有趣的亟待解决的研究课题。

   Quantum computing is revolutionizing cryptography. Many widely
   deployed cryptosystems (e.g. RSA) will be broken due to efficient
   quantum algorithms. I will introduce such challenges and
   opportunities that cryptography faces in a quantum era, and share
   exciting future research directions.

#### **Brif Bio.** of Dr. Fang Song: 

Dr. Fang Song is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science
Department at the Portland State University starting Fall 2016. He was
a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Quantum Computing and the
Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of
Waterloo during 2013 to 2016. He completed his PhD in 2013 in Computer
Science and Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University, under
the supervision of Prof. Sean Hallgren. Prior to that, he received his
bachelor’s degree from University of Science & Technology of China in
2008. He has served on the committee of [QIP 2017](){:target="_blank"} and [PKC 2017](http://www.iacr.org/workshops/pkc2017/index.php){:target="_blank"}. 

His research interests lie in cryptography, especially in the presence
of quantum attacks (a.k.a. post-quantum crypto), quantum algorithms,
computational complexity and theoretical computer science broadly.

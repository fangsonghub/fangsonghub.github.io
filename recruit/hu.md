宋方教授将介绍他在**密码学**及**量子计算**等方向的研究。同时他会介绍关于申请攻读他的博士学位的相关信息。欢迎各位前来交流，尤其是有意出国留学的同学！

Dr. Fang Song will give a tour about his research on the challenges
and opportunites that modern cryptography encounters due to the new
computation paradigm of quantum computing. He will also take the
opportunity to introduce the PhD positions he has available to work in
cryptography, quantum computing and theoretical computer science in
general. All all welcome, especially students who are interested in studying abroad!

#### **Brif Bio.** of Dr. Fang Song: 

Dr. Fang Song is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science
Department at the Portland State University starting Fall 2016. He was
a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Quantum Computing and the
Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of
Waterloo during 2013 to 2016. He completed his PhD in 2013 in Computer
Science and Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University, under
the supervision of Prof. Sean Hallgren. Prior to that, he received my
bachelor’s degree from University of Science & Technology of China in
2008.

His research interests lie in cryptography, especially in the presence
of quantum attacks (a.k.a. post-quantum crypto), quantum algorithms,
computational complexity and theoretical computer science broadly.

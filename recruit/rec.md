I am inviting PhD applications in _cryptography, quantum computing,
and general areas of theoretical computer science_ (TCS) starting
**Fall 2017**, in the [Computer Science Department](computer-science/)
at [Portland State University](http://www.pdx.edu/). Portland State
University is located in the heart of [Portland,
Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon), one of
America's most dynamic cities. It gives unmatched access to career
connections (e.g.,
[Intel](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html)) and an
internationally acclaimed culture scene. Competitive financial support
are available with comprehensive benefits.

A solid math background and strong interest in TCS are
crucial. Suitable students from majors other than computer science
(Math, Physics, Electrical Engineering etc.) are also encouraged to
apply. It is advised that you reach me to discuss your
individual case. 

Find **More Information** at
[http://www.fangsong.info/recruit/]({{base}}/recruit/). Please do not
hesitate to inquire me for any questions.

*  **Email**: [fang.song at pdx.edu](mailto:fsong@pdx.edu)
*  **Application Deadline**: March 1, 2017 for starting in Fall 2017
   (official date). However, review starts immediately upon receiving
   your complete application, so please start early.
*  **How to apply**: Please follow the
guideline
[https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/graduate-admission][gradapplink]. Master's
degree is **NOT** required for the PhD application. Please **mention
my name** in your application, or preferably get in touch with me
during the application process.

*  **Highlight of my research**: 
   * designing quantum algorithms, especially for problems that are critical to cryptography;
   * designing quantum-resistant _classical_ cryptosystems
   (a.k.a. post-quantum cryptography); 
   * developing formal methods for
   analyzing security against quantum attacks; 
   * designing cryptographic constructions empowering quantum information
     processing (i.e. quantum cryptography)
   * understanding the limits and strenths of quantum computation.

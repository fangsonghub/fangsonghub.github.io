## Books 

### Text

* (Required) [Introduction to Modern
Cryptography](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html){:target="_blank"}
(2nd edition) by [Jonathan
Katz](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz){:target="_blank"} and [Yehuda
Lindell](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~lindell/){:target="_blank"}.  Chapman

errta and other updates about the book.
* We will refer to Boneh and Shoup's onging book occasionally:
[A Graduate Course on Applied Cryptography](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cryptobook/){:target="_blank"}.
* For thoery-oriented students, Goldreich's two volume text on theory
  of cryptography is the place to go: [Foundations of
  Cryptography](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/foc-book.html){:target="_blank"}.

### Applied crypto

These tend to be less careful and precise about definitions and
proofs, but they are excellent references for more examples of
concrete cryptosystems used in practice. After this course, you should
understand how to critically evaluate the merits or deficiencies of
the cryptosystems described below (and any new cryptographic constructions you encounter).

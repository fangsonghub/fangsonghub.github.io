## Instructions

2 people group projects. You may choose one of the options below.
* **Research project**. Take any route to gain some research
  experience.
  *  _literature review_. Pick a topic of interest, and summarize the
state of art of it. The final outcome would be a _survey_ paper
including open problems.
  *  _original research_. Challenge yourself with some open question
   in the field. You are encouraged to explore the potential of
   quantum computing in your own research area. Be _creative_ and keep
   a _critical_ mind.

*  **Programming project**. Sure, why not get your hands dirty?  You
   may demonstrate some typical models, especially in real-world
   applications, compare different models, and test inference/learning
   algorithms.
   
*  **Societal-impact project**. How is PGM shaping the daily life?
   What is the distribution of research and education efforts across
   the country? Are resources easily available? Is the research
   in this direction influencing diversity and equity, and how?
   
### Milestones
*  **Proposal**: 1-2 pages consisting of 1) the topic, background,
   context, and motivation; 2) identify a few core references; and 3)
   a goal you intend to achieve and a plan. (10%)
*  **Oral presentation**: Each group will have about 30mins to present
   your project including Q&A. Your need to demonstrate both _breath_
   and _depth_. Aim for a clear introduction that would engage the
   audience, and then explain one or two key technical ideas in some
   detail. Every group member needs to participate, and your group
   will be graded by other fellow students. (20%)
*  **Final report**: ~10 pages. This should resemble a research paper:
   1) a short abstract; 2) an introduction that motivates the topic
   and offers an overview of the entire report; 3) details including
   proper preliminary materials (e.g., notations & definitions),
   explaining some main technical results; and finally 4) further
   discussion and open questions. (10%)
*  **Report format**: I recommend you to typeset your reports in
   _LaTeX_, and manage your bibliography using BibTeX (your will earn
   extra credit if you do so). You should use single-column,
   single-space (between lines) format on letter-size papers. You may
   adopt the style of popular conference proceedings (e.g.,
   [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/StyleFiles)).

### Timeline (Tentative)
*  **Week 1 - 3**: forming groups.
*  **Week 4 - 5**: discussing project ideas.
*  **Feb. 4**: proposal due, 11:59pm anytime on Earth. 
*  **Week 10**: in-class presentations. 
*  **Mar. 18**: final report due, 11:59pm anytime on Earth.

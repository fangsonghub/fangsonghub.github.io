## Announcement
*  <2020-12-30 Wed> Welcome! Please stay tuned for more updates. We
   will work together through this unprecedented situation. Stay
   informed of PSU's updates and resources regarding
   [COVID-19](https://www.pdx.edu/coronavirus-response){:target="_blank"}.

## About
*  **Syllabus**:
   [TBD]({{base}}/teaching/w21_5610_pgm/w21_pgm_syllabus.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 
*  **Instructor**: Prof. [Fang Song]({{base}}/) 
*  **Email**: fsong "AT" pdx.edu. Please start your email subject line
   with "w21-5610-pgm". 
*  **Lectures**: TR 12:00 - 13:15, remotely via Zoom. Please check D2L for
   instructions.
*  **Office hours**: TBD
*  **Overview**: This course will introduce probabilistic graphical
   models and investigate emerging applications. Graphical models
   bring together graph theory and probability theory, and provide a
   flexible framework for modeling probabilistic distributions with
   complex dependencies. This course will cover the key formalisms and
   main techniques to construct them and to solve optimization and
   learning problems.
*  **Prerequisite**: You must be comfortable with reading and writing
   mathematical proofs. Maturity in algorithm analysis, linear
   algebra, and basic probability theory is essential.
*  **Text**: No required text. See [Resource
   page]({{base}}/teaching/w21_5684_alg/resource/) for suggested texts
   and additional useful materials.

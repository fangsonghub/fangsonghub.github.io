*  **Overview**: This course will introduce probabilistic graphical
   models and investigate emerging applications. Graphical models
   bring together graph theory and probability theory, and provide a
   flexible framework for modeling probabilistic distributions with
   complex dependencies. This course will cover the key formalisms and
   main techniques to construct them and to solve optimization and
   learning problems.
*  **Prerequisite**: You must be comfortable with reading and writing
   mathematical proofs. Familiarity with algorithm analysis, linear
   algebra, and basic probability theory is essential.
*  **Text**: No required text. See [Resource
   page]({{base}}/teaching/w21_5610_pgm/resource/) for suggested texts
   and additional useful materials.

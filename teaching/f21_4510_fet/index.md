*  **Overview**: This course will introduce probabilistic graphical
   models and investigate emerging applications. Graphical models
   bring together graph theory and probability theory, and provide a
   flexible framework for modeling probabilistic distributions with
   complex dependencies. This course will cover the key formalisms and
   main techniques to construct them and to solve optimization and
   learning problems.

   mathematical proofs. Familiarity with algorithm analysis, linear
   algebra, and basic probability theory is essential.

   page]({{base}}/teaching/w21_5610_pgm/resource/) for suggested texts
   and additional useful materials.

*  **Overview**: Emerging technologies, such as machine learning,
   quantum computing, modern cryptography, and big data analysis, have
   shown increasing significance of mathematical skills that go beyond
   a conventional discrete math course. Probability theory and linear
   algebra are evidently among the most essential. This course
   synthesizes fundamental theories and tools of probability and
   linear algebra with a slightly heavier weight on probability
   theory, and showcases applications in various topics in computer
   science. It aims to build a stronger foundation to facilitate
   future exploration in the emerging technologies.
*  **Prerequisite**: CS 350. This course is theoretical in nature and
   contains extensive practice on math and analytical problems as well
   as writing mathematical proofs.
*  **Text**: No required text. See [Resource
   page]({{base}}/teaching/w21_5610_pgm/resource/) for suggested texts
   and additional useful materials.

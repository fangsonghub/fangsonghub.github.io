## Policy

* **Grading Policy**: Homework 50%, Project 40%, Participation 10%.
* **Homework**: You must turn in hard copies of your assignments
     before the class begins on the due date. The solutions must be
     intelligible. I encourage you to type your homework with Markdown
     or Latex (and submit the printouts). _Late homework_ is
     acceptable, but there will be a penalty of 30% (<1 day), 60% (1-2
     days), 100% (>2 days).
* **Collaboration** in small group on homework problems is _highly
     encouraged_. However, each person must write up their solutions
     independently. For each problem that you have collaborated with
     others, you must list the names of your collaborators.
* **Course project**: you will form a group of 3 people maximum and
  explore research topics related to this course. You may choose to
  survey a specific topic or take on original research problems. It
  will be evaluated progressively: proposal (5%), mid-term report
  (5%), oral presentation (15%), final report (15%). Details such as
  suggested topics will be provided after the class begins.
*  **Academic integrity**: Students will be responsible for following the [PSU Student Conduct Code](http://www.pdx.edu/dos/codeofconduct). 
*  **Students with disabilities**: If you need academic accommodations, you should register with
   the
   [Disability Resource Center](https://www.pdx.edu/drc/)
   and notify the instructor immediately to arrange for support
   services.

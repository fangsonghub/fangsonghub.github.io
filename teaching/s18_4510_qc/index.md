## Announcement
*  Welcome! Please enroll on
   Piazza
   [here](https://piazza.com/pdx/spring2018/cs410510/home){:target="_blank"}.

## About

The law of quantum physics enables **quantum computing**, a
revolutionary paradigm of computation. A host of fundamental problems
can be solved efficiently on a quantum computer, sometimes
expoentially faster than what is possible on a classical computer. The
power of quantum computing has promising applications such as in
chemistry, machine learning, and cryptography (security backbone of
the Internet will be **broken** by quantum attackers!).

In this course, we will study the basic principles and techniques of
quantum computing, and discuss some of the applications. The goal is
to equip you with the essential tools to appreciate, further explore
and (even better) devote to this exciting research area. Tentative
topics include: quantum states and circuits, entanglement, quantum
algorithms (e.g., Grover's search and Shor's factoring algorithms),
quantum complexity theory, quantum error correction, and applications
in cryptography.

*  **Prerequisite**: maturity in algorithm analysis and mathematics
   (espeically linear algebra, basic probability thoery and group
   thoery). Quantum mechanics is helpful, but **NOT** required. This
   course will be theory-oriented involving reading and writing lots
   of mathematical proofs. I **strongly** recommend you skimming
   through the first few lectures of these notes by
   Watrous
   [PDF](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/CPSC519/LectureNotes/all.pdf){:target="_blank"}
   and by
   Vazirani
   [link](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/quantum.html){:target="_blank"}
   to get a sense what we will be dealing with. If you feel uncertain,
   please email me to set an appoinment, and I'd be happy to discuss
   with you.

   and also on the [ADMIN]({{base}}/teaching/s18_4510_qc/admin/) page.
*  **Instructor**: Prof. [Fang Song]({{base}}/) @ FAB 120-07. Email: fsong "AT" pdx.edu.
*  **Lectures**: MW 2:00 - 3:50 pm @ FAB 10
*  **Office hours**: M 4 - 5pm, Th 1 - 2pm, and by appointment. 
*  **Text**: no required ones. We will primarily follow lecture notes
and read research papers. See the
**resource** [page]({{base}}/teaching/s18_4510_qc/resource/) for
recommended books and other useful materials related to the course.
*  **Piazza**: This term we will be using Piazza for class
 discussion. Find
 our
 [class page here](https://piazza.com/pdx/spring2018/cs410510/home){:target="_blank"}. The
 system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently
 from classmates and myself. I encourage you to post your questions on
 Piazza.

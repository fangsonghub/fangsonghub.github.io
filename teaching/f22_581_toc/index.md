*  **Overview**: Computation is a familiar term to all computer
   scientists. But what is computation after all? What problems are
   computable (_Computability_), and how “efficient” can we compute
   them (_Complexity_)? This course, assuming a prior introductory
   exposure to the theory of computation, continues an in-depth
   exploration to these fundamental questions. After reviewing
   computability, the focus will be on computational complexity,
   including time, space, randomness complexity, and selected topics
   such as interactive proof systems and quantum computing.
*  **Prerequisite**: CS 311 or equivalent. You need to be familiar
   with the basics of computability theory, and be comfortable with
   reading and writing mathematical proofs.

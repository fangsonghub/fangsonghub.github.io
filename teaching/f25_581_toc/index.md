## About

*  **Instructor**: Prof. [Fang Song]({{base}}/) 
*  **Email**: fsong "AT" pdx.edu. Start your email subject line
   with "f25-581". Slack is preferred. 
*  **Lectures**: MW 11:00 - 12:15 @ xxx
*  **Office hours**: xxx @ FAB 120-25, and by appointment. 
*  **Overview**: Computation is a familiar term to all computer
   scientists. But what is computation after all? What problems are
   computable (_Computability_), and how “efficient” can we compute
   them (_Complexity_)? This course will be investigating these
   fundamental questions. 
*  **Prerequisite**: CS 311 or equivalent. You need to be familiar
   with the basics of computability theory, and be comfortable with
   reading and writing mathematical proofs.
*  **Text**: [**S3**] Michael Sipser. _Introduction to the Theory of
   Computation_, 3rd ed. Cengage Learning, 2012. Some topics will rely
   on lecture notes and additional readings. See [Resource
   page]({{base}}/teaching/f25_581_toc/resource/) for useful
   materials.

### About this module

Cryptography is facing devastating challenges in an era of quantum
computing. Many public-key cryptosystems widely deployed on the
Internet will be broken by quantum attackers due to efficient quantum
algorithms such as Shor's factoring algorithm. This calls for
designing cryptosystems that (hopefully) can resist quantum attacks,
a.k.a. _post-quantum cryptography_ (PQC).

This module will give an overview of a few candidate directions on PQC. We will use public-key signature and encryption schemes as running examples. Instead of going over various constructions, I will take a unified approach by outlining general frameworks for cryptographic designs and showing how to instantiate them from each candidate direction. Quantum security of these new proposals will be discussed, which includes (quantum) hardness of underlying computational problems as well as formal security analyses in the presence of quantum adversaries (which have not received enough emphasis in the literature).

Check out the tentative [schedule](#tentative-schedule) below.

## Resources


*   A (non-exhaustive & growing) **[list]({{base}}/teaching/s16_uw_pqc/resource/)** of study materials & references on post-qantum cryptography.
*   Relevant readings will be specified for each lecture.

## Policy


### For academic credit

A short homework assignment will be handed out after the last lecture, which will be (typically) due two weeks after the end of the module.

In order to complete QIC 891 for academic credit, students must complete 3 modules and a project. You may only register in QIC 891 if you intend on completing 3 modules and associated homework and project by August 2016\.

Permission numbers are required to enroll in this course. Please contact [Monica Dey](https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/people/profile/mdey/). Find more information [here](https://cryptoworks21.uwaterloo.ca/training/2016modules/).


### For CryptoWorks21 qualification

Students in the CryptoWorks21 training program may complete any eligible modules order to prepare for a CryptoWorks21 technical skills qualification exam on the module topic. Technical skills qualification exams will take place at the end of each module.

Students may also count these modules, including assignments and final project, towards academic credit as part of QIC 891.

**This module is eligible for technical skill qualification**. An exam (format TBD) will be given at a later point.

II note: [pdf]({{base}}/teaching/s16_uw_pqc/qic891_pqc_lec1.pdf)]

*   Setting the scene: threats to cryptography from quantum attacks. Two major aspects: 1) underlying hard problems are broken and 2) classical framework for security analysis falls apart.
*   Introduce main proposals to resist quantum attacks based on: 1) point lattices; 2) coding theory; 3) multivariate polynomials; and 4) signature schemes using cryptographic hash functions.
*   Central candidate problems for building PQC, e.g. SIS&LWE (lattice-based), syndrome decoding (code-based), multivariate equations (MQ-based).

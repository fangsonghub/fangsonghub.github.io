\noindent \textbf{Instructions.}

\begin{itemize} 
\item Typeset your submission by \LaTeX, and submit in PDF
  format. Your solutions will be graded on \emph{correctness} and
  \emph{clarity}. You should only submit work that you believe to be
  correct, and you will get significantly more partial credit if you
  clearly identify the gap(s) in your solution. You may opt for the
  ``Iâ€™ll take 15\%'' option (details in Syllabus).
\item You may collaborate with others on this problem set.  However,
  you must \textbf{{write up your own solutions}} and \textbf{{list
      your collaborators and any external sources}} for each
  problem. Be ready to explain your solutions orally to a course staff
  if asked.
\item For problems that require you to provide an algorithm, you must
  give a precise description of the algorithm, together with a proof
  of correctness and an analysis of its running time. You may use
  algorithms from class as subroutines. You may also use any facts
  that we proved in class or from the book.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This assignment contains \numquestions\ questions,
\numpages\ pages for the total of \numpoints \ points and
\numbonuspoints\ bonus points. A random subset of the problems will be
graded. \medskip

\begin{questions}

\def\scc{\text{SCC}}  
\question (Component graph) Given a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, we
  define another graph $G^{\scc} =(V^\scc, E^\scc)$ called the
  \emph{component graph} as follows. Suppose that $G$ has strongly
  connected components $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_k$. The vertex set
  $V^\scc$ is $\{v_1,\ldots,v_k\}$ where $v_i\in C_i$. There is an
  edge $ (v_i,v_j) \in E^\scc$ if $G$ contains a directed edge
  $x\to y$ for some $x\in C_i$ and some $y\in C_j$. Alternatively,
  imagine contracting all edges whose incident vertices are within the
  same strongly connected component of $G$, and the resulting graph
  will be $G^\scc$.
  \begin{parts}
  \part[10] Prove or disapprove that $G^\scc$ is a DAG.
    
    \bonuspart[10] Give an $O(|V|+|E|)$-time algorithm to compute the
    component graph of a directed graph $G = (V,E)$.
    
  \end{parts}
\newpage

\question[10] (Singly connected graph) A directed graph $G=(V,E)$ is
  \emph{singly} connected if $G$ contains at most one simple (i.e. no
  vertex repeated) path from $u$ to $v$ for all vertices $u,v\in V
  $. Give an efficient algorithm to determine whether or not a
  directed graph is singly connected.

\newpage
  
\question (Semi-connected graphs) A directed graph $G$ is
  \emph{semi-connected} if, for every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$,
  either $u$ is reachable from $v$ or $v$ is reachable from $u$ (or
  both).
  \begin{parts}
  \part[5] Give an example of a DAG with a unique source (a source is
    a vertex with no entering edges) that is \textbf{not}
    semi-connected.
  \part[10] Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether a
    given DAG is semi-connected. 
    \part[10] 
      Describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether an
      arbitrary directed graph is semi-connected.
  \end{parts}

\newpage  

\question An \emph{Euler tour} of a strongly connected, directed graph
  $G = (V, E)$ is a cycle that traverses each \emph{edge} of $G$
  exactly once, although it may visit a vertex more than once.

  \begin{parts}
  \part[10] Show that $G$ has an Euler tour if and only if
    $\text{in-degree}(v) = \text{out-degree}(v)$ for each vertex 
    $v \in V$.
  \part[10] Describe an $O(|E|)$-time algorithm to find an Euler tour
    of $G$ if one exists.
  \end{parts}

## About
*  **Syllabus**:
   [PDF]({{base}}/teaching/f21_581_toc/f21_581_toc_syllabus.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
*  **Instructor**: Prof. [Fang Song]({{base}}/) 
*  **Email**: fsong "AT" pdx.edu. Start your email subject line
   with "f21-581-toc". 
*  **Lectures**: TR 14:00 - 15:15 @ CH 449

*  **Overview**: Computation is a familiar term to all computer
   scientists. But what is computation after all? What problems are
   computable (Computability), and how “efficient” can we compute them
   (Complexity)? This course, assuming a prior introductory exposure
   to the theory of computation, continues an in-depth exploration to
   these fundamental questions. The focus will be on computational
   complexity, including time, space, randomness complexity. We will
   also dive into selected advanced topics such as interactive proof
   systems and quantum computing.
*  **Prerequisite**: CS 311 or equivalent. You need to be familiar
   with the basics of computability theory, and be comfortable with
   reading and writing mathematical proofs.
*  **Text**: No required text. See [Resource
   page]({{base}}/teaching/f21_581_toc/resource/) for suggested texts
   and additional useful materials.

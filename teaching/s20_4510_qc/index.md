## Announcement
*  <2020-03-23 Mon> Sign up on **Campuswire** and
   **Gradescope**. Find instructions at the bottom.
*  <2020-03-22 Sun> Welcome! Please stay tuned for more updates. We
   will work together through this unprecedented situation. Stay
   informed of PSU's updates and resources regarding
   [COVID-19](https://www.pdx.edu/coronavirus-response){:target="_blank"}.

## About
*  **Syllabus**:
   [PDF]({{base}}/teaching/s20_4510_qc/s20_qc_syllabus_update.pdf){:target="_blank"}. More admin. info. can be found on [FAQs]({{base}}/teaching/s20_4510_qc/admin/). 
*  **Instructor**: Prof. [Fang Song]({{base}}/) 
*  **Email**: fsong "AT" pdx.edu. Please start your email subject line
   with "s20-qc". 
*  **Lectures**: F 12:45 - 16:25, remotely via Zoom. Please check D2L for
   instructions.
*  **Office hours**: W 4 - 5:30pm and by appointment. 
*  **Overview**: The law of quantum physics enables quantum computing,
   a new paradigm of computation. It allows for solving certain
   problems that are intractable on classical computers. In this
   course, we will study the basic principles and techniques of
   quantum computing, and discuss some exciting applications. 
   
   Aside from the training in analytical skills, an important goal of
   this course is to make you a more critical reader so you will have
   a better idea when flooded with news articles on quantum
   computing. For the tech-savy students, this course would also
   prepare you for future exploration in this emerging field.
*  **Prerequisite**: Previous knowledge in quantum mechanics is NOT
   required. This course will be theory-oriented involving reading and
   writing mathematical proofs. Maturity in algorithm analysis, linear
   algebra, and basic probability theory will be essential.
*  **Text**: No required text. We will primarily follow online lecture
   notes and read papers. Below are a few recommended texts (online
   access available via PSU library). The [Resource page]({{base}}/teaching/s20_4510_qc/resource/) contains additional
   useful materials.

## Announcement
*  <2020-03-22 Sun> Welcome! Please stay tuned for more updates.

## About
*  **Syllabus**:
   [PDF]({{base}}/teaching/s20_4510_qc/s20_qc_syllabus_update.pdf){:target="_blank"}. under
   major updating, will be posted soon.
*  **Instructor**: Prof. [Fang Song]({{base}}/) 
*  **Email**: fsong "AT" pdx.edu. Please start your email subject line
   with "s20-qc". 
*  **Lectures**: F 12:45 - 16:25, remotely via Zoom. Please check D2L for
   instructions.
*  **Office hours**: W 4 - 5pm and by appointment. 
*  **Overview**: The law of quantum physics enables quantum computing,
   a new paradigm of computation. It allows for solving certain
   problems that are intractable on classical computers. In this
   course, we will study the basic principles and techniques of
   quantum computing, and discuss some exciting applications. 
   
   For the tech-savy students, this would prepare you for future
   exploration in this emerging field. Aside from the training in
   analytical skills, an important goal of this course is to make you
   a more critical reader so you have a better idea when flooded with
   news articles on quantum computing.
*  **Prerequisite**: Previous knowledge in quantum mechanics is NOT
   required. This course will be theory-oriented involving reading and
   writing mathematical proofs. Maturity in algorithm analysis, linear
   algebra, and basic probability theory will be essential.
*  **Text**: No required text. We will primarily follow online lecture
   notes and read papers. Below are a few recommended texts (online
   access available via PSU library). The **Resource**
   [page]({{base}}/teaching/s20_4510_qc/resource/) contains additional
   useful materials.

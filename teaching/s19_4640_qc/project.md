## Instructions

2-3 people group projects. You may go with one (or superposition) of
the following options
*  _literature review_. Pick a topic of interest, and summarize the
state of art of it. The final outcome would be a _survey_ paper
including open problems.
*  _completing "folklore"_. There are ``folklore'' results in the
   filed or missing details in class that are worth spelling out more
   carefully. You will conduct a careful study a dedicated problem and
   give a thorough exposition on it.
*  _original research_. Challenge yourself with some open question in
   the field. You are encouraged to explore the potential of quantum
   computing in your own research area. Be _creative_ and keep a
   _critical_ mind. 
*  _quantum programming_. Implement some quantum algorithms and
   protocols in quantum programming platforms (e.g., Q#,Quirky,IBM
   QISKIT), and go beyond by optimizing the circuit, estimating the
   cost, and testing variations (e.g., robustness against noise).

### Specs
*  **Proposal**: 1-2 pages consisting of 1) the topic, background,
   context, and motivation; 2) identify a few core papers to be
   studied; and 3) a goal you intend to achieve and a plan.
*  **Oral presentation**: Each group will have about 30mins to present
   your project including Q&A. Your need to demonstrate both _breath_
   and _depth_. Aim for a clear introduction that would **interest**
   the audience, and then explain 1-2 technical ideas in some
   detail. Every group member needs to participate, and your group
   will be graded by other fellow students. You may use slides or
   whiteboard.
*  **Final report**: ~10 pages. This should resemble a research paper:
   1) a short abstract; 2) an introduction that motivates the
   topic/problem and gives an overview of the entire report; 3)
   details including proper preliminary materials (e.g., notations &
   defintions), explaning some main technical results; and finally 4)
   further discussion and open questions.
*  **Report format**: I recommend you to typeset your reports in
   **LaTeX**, and manage your bibliography using BibTeX. The [resource
   page]({{base}}/teaching/s19_4640_qc/resource/) has links to
   materials to pick up LaTeX. You should use single-column,
   single-space (between lines) format on letter-size papers.

### Timeline (Tentative)
*  **Week 1 & 3**: forming groups.
*  **Week 4 & 5**: discussing project ideas.
*  **February 18**: proposal due before class.
*  **Week 14-15**: in-class presentations. 
*  **May 03**: final report due, 11:59pm anytime on Earth.

   algorithm)?

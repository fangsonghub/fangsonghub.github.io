## About
*  **Syllabus**:
   [PDF]({{base}}/teaching/s19_4640_qc/CSCE440640_S19_syllabus.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 
*  **Overview**: The law of quantum physics enables quantum computing, a new paradigm of computation. It allows for solving certain problems that are intractable on classical computers. In this course, we will study the basic principles and techniques of quantum computing, and discuss some exciting applications. The goal is to equip you with the essential tools to appreciate and further pursue in this advancing area. 
*  **Prerequisite**: Previous knowledge in quantum mechanics is NOT required. This course will be theory-oriented involving reading and writing a lot of mathematical proofs. Maturity in algorithm analysis, linear algebra, and basic probability theory will be essential. 
*  **Instructor**: Prof. [Fang Song]({{base}}/) @ HRBB 427B 
*  **Email**: fang.song "AT" tamu.edu. Start your subject line with "S19-QC"
*  **Lectures**: M/W 5:45 – 7pm @ HRBB 126
*  **Office hours**: T 3 – 5 pm and by appointment
*  **Text**: No text required. We will primarily follow online lecture notes. Here are a few recommended texts (online access available via TAMU library. Print copies on reserve at Evans library): 
    *  [**KLM**] Phillip Kaye, Raymond Laflamme, Michele Mosca, An Introduction to Quantum Computing, Oxford University Press (2007). [Library elink](https://libcat.tamu.edu/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=5357750){:target="_blank"} ([Errata](http://qcintro.com/))

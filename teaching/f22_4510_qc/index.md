*  **Overview**: The law of quantum physics enables quantum computing,
   a new paradigm of computation. It enables solving some problems
   that are intractable on classical computers. In this course, we
   will study the basic principles and techniques of quantum
   computing, and discuss some exciting applications. Aside from the
   technical contents, an important goal of this course is to make you
   a more critical reader so you will have a better idea when flooded
   with news articles on quantum computing. For the theory-savy
   students, this course would also prepare you for future exploration
   in this emerging field.
*  **Prerequisite**: Previous knowledge in quantum mechanics is NOT
   required. This course will be theory-oriented involving reading and
   writing mathematical proofs. Maturity in algorithm analysis, linear
   algebra, and basic probability theory will be essential.
*  **Text**: The [Resource
   page]({{base}}/teaching/s22_4510_qc/resource/) contains additional
   useful materials.

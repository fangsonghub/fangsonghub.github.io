## About

The law of quantum physics is revolutionizing what feasible
computation may look like, and a new paradigm of **quantum computing**
has been emerging. Quantum computers can solve some fundamental
problems efficiently, sometimes expoentially faster than what we can
on a classical computer. Numerous promising applications are being
developed such as in chemistry, machine learning, and especially
cryptography (the Internet will be **broken** by quantum attackers!).

In this course, we will study the basic principles and techniques of
quantum computing, and discuss some of the applications. The goal is
to equip you with the essential tools to appreciate, further explore
and (even better) devote to this exciting research area. Tentative
topics include: quantum states and circuits, entanglement, quantum
algorithms (e.g., Grover's search and Shor's factoring algorithms),
quantum complexity theory, quantum error-correcting codes, and
applications in cryptography.

*  **Prerequisite**: maturity in algorithm analysis and mathematics
   (espeically linear algebra, basic probability thoery and group
   thoery). Quantum mechanics is helpful, but **NOT** required. This
   course will be theory-oriented involving reading and writing lots
   of mathematical proofs. I **strongly** recommend you skimming through the first few lectures of these notes by Watrous [PDF](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/CPSC519/LectureNotes/all.pdf){:target="_blank"} and by Vazirani [link](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/quantum.html){:target="_blank"} to get a sense what we will be dealing with. If you feel uncertain, please email me to
   set an appoinment, and I'd be happy to discuss with you. 
*  **Syllabus**: [PDF]({{base}}/teaching/s17_4510_qc/s17_qc_syllabus.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and also on the [administratives]({{base}}/teaching/s17_4510_qc/admin/) page.
*  **Instructor**: Prof. [Fang Song]({{base}}/) @ FAB 120-07. Email: fsong "AT" pdx.edu.
*  **Lectures**: Tu/Th 2:00 - 3:50 pm @ <strike>FAB 47</strike> <b style="color: red;">Cramer Hall 449<b>.
*  **Office hours**: Tu/W 4 - 5pm, or by appointment. 
*  **Course mailing list**: s17qc@cs.pdx.edu. Follow this [link](https://mailhost.cecs.pdx.edu/mailman/listinfo/s17qc){:target="_blank"} to subscribe. 
*  **Text**: no required ones. We will primarily follow lecture notes
and read research papers. See the
**resource** [page]({{base}}/teaching/s17_4510_qc/resource/) for
recommended books and other useful materials related to the course.

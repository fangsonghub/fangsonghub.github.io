*  <2017-01-30 Mon> Course webpage is up and more to come! Please let
   me know for any questions or concerns. 

## About

The law of quantum physics is revolutionizing what feasible
computation should be, and a new paradigm of **quantum computing** has
been emerging. There are efficient quantum algorithms for solving
important problems which we do not know how to otherwise on a
classical computer. Numerous promising applications are being
developed such as in chemistry, machine learning, and especially
cryptography (the Internet will be **broken** by quantum
attackers!). In this course, we will study the basic principles and
techniques of quantum computing, and discuss some of the
applications. The goal is to equip you with the essential tools to
appreciate, further explore and (even better) devote to this exciting
research area. Tentative topics include: quantum states and circuits,
entanglement, quantum algorithms (e.g., Grover's search and Shor's
factoring algorithms), quantum complexity theory, quantum
error-correcting codes, and applications in cryptography. 

*  **Prerequisite**: maturity in algorithm analysis and mathematics
   (espeically basic probability thoery, group thoery, and linear
   algebra). Quantum mechanics is helpful, but **NOT** required. This
   course will be theory-oriented involving reading and writing lots
   of mathematical proofs. If you feel uncertain, please email me to
   set an appoinment, and I'd be happy to discuss with you.
*  **Syllabus**: [PDF]({{base}}/teaching/s17_4510_qc/syllabus.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and more on the [administratives]({{base}}/teaching/s17_4510_qc/admin/) page.
*  **Instructor**: [Fang Song]({{base}}/) @ FAB 120-07. Email: fsong "AT" pdx.edu.
*  **Lectures**: Tu/Th 2:00 - 3:50 pm @ TBD.
*  **Office hours**: Tu/W 4 - 5pm, or by appointment. 
*  **Text**: no required ones. We will primarily follow lecture notes
and read research papers. See the
**resource** [page]({{base}}/teaching/s17_4510_qc/resource/) for
recommended books and other useful materials related to the course.

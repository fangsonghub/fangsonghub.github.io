*  **Overview**: Cryptography is usually described as the _art_ of
secret writing. _Modern_ cryptography has transformed cryptography
into a mathematically rigorous subject. This course will explore the
key concepts in modern cryptography, including _private-key
cryptography_ such as perfect secrecy, block ciphers, crytographic
hash functions and message authentication, as well as _public-key
cryptography_ such as public-key encryption and digital signatures. We
will also touch on some emerging topics such as (post-) quantum
cryptography. Our approch will be conceptual and theoretical: we focus
on the _ideas_ rather than _implementations_, and on how to define and
reason about security in a mathematically sound manner. The ultimate
goal will be to build a cryptographic way of thinking.
*  **Prerequisite**: CS 350 or equivalent. It is crucial that you are
comfortable with (preferably enjoy) reading and writing mathematical
proofs. It's helpful if you are familiar with (randomized) algorithms,
basic probability theory and linear algebra. If you are uncertain
about your background please don't hesitate to talk with
me. Programming skills are not required for this course.

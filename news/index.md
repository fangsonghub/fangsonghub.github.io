*  <2019-08-28 Wed> Slides of the tutorial at the [9th International
   Conference on Quantum Cryptography](http://2019.qcrypt.net/), now
   available under [Research]({{base}}/research/#other-talks) Explore
   **Zero-knowledge proofs** in a quantum world, and solve the open
   questions.

<!--*  I will be offering an introductory course on **Quantum computing** in Spring 2017. Check out the course information [here]({{base}}/teaching/s17_4510_qc/). -->

<!--* **September 2018**: I have a **post-doctorate** fellow position available at TAMU to work on quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography. The focus will be either on quantum provable security or quantum algorithms for post-quantum candidate problems. Starting date is flexible, and an official ad will be out soon. Shoot me an email if you (or know someone who) are interested and have related research experience. -->
*   **I AM HIRING!** I am looking for self-motivated students who are
    interested in pursuing a PhD degree with me. Please feel free
    to reach me! 

*  I will serve on the program committee of [PQCrypto 2018](http://www.math.fau.edu/pqcrypto2018/){:target="_blank"}. It will be co-located with the 1st [NIST PQC Standardization Conference](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/workshops-and-timeline){:target="_blank"} at **Fort Lauderdale, Florida** Please submit your nice research results and hope to meet you there!
<!-- *  With an undergraduate and a Master's student, we prove optimimal
   quantum query lower bounds and give quantum algorithms for finding
   collisions in a family of non-uniform random functions. Read
   more [here](http://ia.cr/2017/688){:target="_blank"}. -->
<!-- *  CBC-MAC and a few others
   were [broken](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05973){:target="_blank"}
   by quantum attacks, But **NMAC** and **HMAC** remain
   quantum-secure, as we prove in our Crypto'17 paper. Check it
   out [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/509){:target="_blank"}. --> 
<!-- *  My talk on **ZK for QMA** at QIP'17 is now avaible on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fXLJBN-KfI&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}.-->	
<!--*  Our department has a tenure-track faculty position available. Read
       more
       [here](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/open-faculty-positions). You
       will like it here!-->
<!--*  [Asiacrypt 2017](http://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2017/){:target="_blank"} will be held in **Hong Kong**, and I am happy to serve on the program committee. Please submit your excellent papers!-->
<!--*  I will serve on the program committee of [PQCrypto 2017](https://2017.pqcrypto.org/conference/){:target="_blank"}.  **Utrecht, the Netherlands** is awaiting your nice research results!-->
<!--*  I organized a one-day event on quantum computing and
   cryptography at Portland, OR. Find the details [here]({{base}}/activity/w17qpdx/) or a poster [PDF]({{base}}/activity/w17qpdx/qpdxposter.pdf){:target="_blank"}.-->
    <!--*   I will serve on the program committee of [QIP 2017](https://www.stationq.com/qip-2017/){:target="_blank"}, hosted by at Microsoft Research in **Redmond, Washington** during Jan 14-20, 2017\. You may as well visit me pre or post QIP [driving 3 hours south](https://goo.gl/maps/aH7GfTLs4tP2){:target="_blank"}. -->
<!--*   I will serve on the program committee of [PKC 2017](http://www.iacr.org/workshops/pkc2017/index.php){:target="_blank"} to be held at the artistic city of **Amsterdam**. Please submit your nice papers!-->

*  <2019-12-21 Sat> I will serve on the program committee of [Crypto
   2020](https://crypto.iacr.org/2020/callforpapers.html){:target="_blank"}. Submit
   your best papers by **February 11 2020**.
*  <2019-08-28 Wed> Slides of the tutorial at the [9th International
   Conference on Quantum Cryptography](http://2019.qcrypt.net/), now
   available under [Research]({{base}}/research/#other-talks) Explore
   **Zero-knowledge proofs** in a quantum world, and solve the open
   questions.
*  <2019-09-01 Sat> I have a **post-doctorate** fellow position
  available at TAMU to work on quantum computing and post-quantum
  cryptography. The focus will be either on quantum provable security
  or quantum algorithms for post-quantum candidate problems. 
*  <2018-09-01 Sat> **I AM HIRING!** I am looking for self-motivated PhD students. Please feel free to
    reach me!
*  <2017-07-17 Mon> I will serve on the program committee of [PQCrypto 2018](http://www.math.fau.edu/pqcrypto2018/){:target="_blank"}. It will be co-located with the 1st [NIST PQC Standardization Conference](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/workshops-and-timeline){:target="_blank"} at **Fort Lauderdale, Florida** Please submit your nice research results!
*  <2017-07-01 Sat> With an undergraduate and a Master's student, we prove optimimal
   quantum query lower bounds and give quantum algorithms for finding
   collisions in a family of non-uniform random functions. Read
   more [here](http://ia.cr/2017/688){:target="_blank"}.
*  <2017-06-01 Thu> CBC-MAC and a few others
   were [broken](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05973){:target="_blank"}
   by quantum attacks. But **NMAC** and **HMAC** remain
   quantum-secure, as we prove in our Crypto'17 paper. Check it out
   [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/509){:target="_blank"}.
* <2017-02-01 Wed> My talk on **ZK for QMA** at QIP'17 is now avaible on
   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fXLJBN-KfI&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}.
* <2017-01-20 Fri> [Asiacrypt
   2017](http://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2017/){:target="_blank"} will be
   held in **Hong Kong**, and I am happy to serve on the program
   committee. Please submit your excellent papers!
* <2017-01-13 Fri> I organized a one-day event on quantum computing
   and cryptography at Portland, OR. Find the details
   [here]({{base}}/activity/w17qpdx/) or a poster
   [PDF]({{base}}/activity/w17qpdx/qpdxposter.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
* <2017-01-10 Tue> I will
   serve on the program committee of [PQCrypto
   2017](https://2017.pqcrypto.org/conference/){:target="_blank"}.
   **Utrecht, the Netherlands** is awaiting your nice research
   results!

* <2016-09-26 Mon> I will serve on the program committee of [QIP
   2017](https://www.stationq.com/qip-2017/){:target="_blank"}, hosted
   by at Microsoft Research in **Redmond, Washington** during Jan
   14-20, 2017. You may as well visit me pre or post QIP [driving 3
   hours

* <2016-09-06 Tue> I will serve on the program committee of [PKC
   2017](http://www.iacr.org/workshops/pkc2017/index.php){:target="_blank"}
   to be held at the artistic city of **Amsterdam**. Please submit
   your nice papers!
